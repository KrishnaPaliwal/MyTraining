Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data(ie data members of the class) with the methods that operate on that data.

Encapsulation is not information hiding

In Java, you can have encapsulated data that is not hidden at all.

Java classes allow bundling data and methods together:

The language facility that bundles data with the operations that perform on that data is encapsulation.
Note that encapsulation guarantees neither data protection nor information hiding.

encapsulation does need some degree of information hiding.an object being strongly or weakly encapsulated
depending on how much of its implementation is hidden.
