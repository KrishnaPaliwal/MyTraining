File Handling :::

Java provides several ways to write a file, we can use FileWriter, BufferedWriter, 
java 7 Files and FileOutputStream to write file in Java.

FileWriter: FileWriter is the simplest way to write a file in java, it provides
overloaded write method to write int, byte array and String to the File. You can also
write part of the String or byte array using FileWriter. FileWriter writes directly 
into Files and should be used only when number of writes are less.

BufferedWriter: BufferedWriter is almost similar to FileWriter but it uses internal
 buffer to write data into File. So if the number of write operations are more, the 
 actual IO operations are less and performance is better. You should use BufferedWriter 
 when number of write operations are more.

FileOutputStream: FileWriter and BufferedWriter are meant to write text to the file 
but when you need raw stream data to be written into file, you should use FileOutputStream 
to write file in java.

Files: Java 7 introduced Files utility class and we can write a file using it’s write 
function, internally it’s using OutputStream to write byte array into file.
