Java System (java.lang.System) Class ::

public final class System extends Object

Java System Class is one of the core classes and I have never seen
any java developer who doesn’t use it. One of the easiest way to log 
information for debugging is System.out.print() function.

System class is final so that we can’t subclass and
override it’s behavior through inheritance.

System class doesn’t provide any public constructors, so we can’t instantiate this class.
