What is a ClassLoader?

We know that Java Program runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When we compile a Java Class, 
it transforms it in the form of bytecode that is platform and machine independent compiled
 program and store it as a .class file. After that when we try to use a Class, 
 Java ClassLoader loads that class into memory.

There are three types of built-in Class Loaders in Java:
1.Bootstrap Class Loader – It loads JDK internal classes, 
typically loads rt.jar and other core classes for example java.lang.* package classes

2.Extensions Class Loader – It loads classes from the JDK extensions directory,
 usually $JAVA_HOME/lib/ext directory.
 
3.System Class Loader – It loads classes from the current classpath that can
 be set while invoking a program using -cp or -classpath command line options.
