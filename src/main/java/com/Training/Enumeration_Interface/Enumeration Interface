The Enumeration Interface :::

The Enumeration interface defines a means to retrieve successive elements from a data structure.
For example, Enumeration defines a method called nextElement that is used to get the next element
in a data structure that contains multiple elements.

This legacy interface has been superceded by Iterator. Although not deprecated,
Enumeration is considered obsolete for new code.

However, it is used by several methods defined by the legacy classes such as Vector and Properties,
is used by several other API classes, and is currently in widespread use in application code.
